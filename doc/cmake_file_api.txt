1. Intro

CMake provides a file-based API that clients may use to get semantic
information about the buildsystems CMake generates. Clients may use the API by
writing query files to a specific location in a build tree to request zero or
more Object Kinds. When CMake generates the buildsystem in that build tree it
will read the query files and write reply files for the client to read.


==============================================================================
                                                            *cmake_file_api_api*

2. API

The API consists of functions that query the CMake File API, functions to read
the reply of the API and classes that wrap the reply.

                                                        *cmake_file_api.queries*

2.1. Queries

Functions to call before configuring CMake in order to instruct it what data
to generate using the API.


                                   *cmake_file_api.write_shared_stateless_query*

write_shared_stateless_query({build}, {kind}, {version}[, {callback}])

Write a shared stateless query for the CMake file API.

The query will be shared with other clients such as IDE's and editors. See the
shared stateless query documentation for more info.

  Parameters: ~

    {build} `string`
      The build directory of the generated buildsystem. It has to be an
      already existing directory on the filesystem.

    {kind} `string`
      The kind of query to send. Valid values are: "codemodel", "cache",
      "cmakeFiles", and "tkolchains". See the object kind documentation for
      more info.

    {version} `number`, `string`
      The major version of the query kind to send. Valid values depend on the
      query kind. See the CMake File API documentation for more info.

    [{callback} `function`, `string`, `nil`]
      It can be a Lua `function`, a Vim command `string`, or `nil`. If not
      `nil`, the method will run asynchronously and call the callback upon
      completion. Otherwise, it will run synchronously.

      "cmakeFiles", and "toolchains". See the object kind documentation for
      more info.

    {version} `number`, `string`
      The major version of the query kind to send. Valid values depend on the
      query kind. See the CMake File API documentation for more info.

    [{callback} `function`, `string`, `nil`]
      It can be a Lua `function`, a Vim command `string`, or `nil`. If not
      `nil`, the method will run asynchronously and call the callback upon
      completion. Otherwise, it will run synchronously.

2.2. Reply

Functions and classes to use after configuring CMake in order to read the
reply of the API.


                                                     *cmake_file_api.read_reply*

read_reply({build}[, {callback}])

Read a reply from the CMake file API (it rhymes!).

See the reply index file documentation for more info.

  Parameters: ~

    {build} `string`
      The build directory of the generated buildsystem. It has to be an
      already existing directory on the filesystem.

    [{callback} `function`, `string`, `nil`]
      It can be a Lua `function`, a Vim command `string`, or `nil`. If not
      `nil`, the method will run asynchronously and call the callback upon
      completion. Otherwise, it will run synchronously.

  Returns: ~

    |cmake_file_api.object|
      Returns an |cmake_file_api.object| represention the reply. All the
      fields of this type are the same as in the reply index file
      documentation except for special fields that have the key "jsonFile".
      These fields are not immediately loaded and are instead initialized as a
      |cmake_file_api.lazy|. Lazy objects have a path field and a load method
      which can run synchronously and asynchronously to retrieve the desired
      field as an |cmake_file_api.object|.
